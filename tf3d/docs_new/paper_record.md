### 3D Semantic Segmentation with Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10275.pdf

Sparse convolutional network suppresses the expansion of the active area after convolution in a sparse pointcloud space by restricting the value change in active field. It is a building block of SparseConvUnet in tf3d.
